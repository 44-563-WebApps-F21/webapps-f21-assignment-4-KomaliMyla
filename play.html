<h4> The Importance of Being Earnest</h4>
<h5> THIRD ACT<br>

    SCENE<br>
    
    Morning-room at the Manor House.<br>

    </h5>


    CECILY.<br>
A most distasteful one.<br>

GWENDOLEN.<br>
But we will not be the first to speak.<br>

CECILY.<br>
Certainly not.<br>

GWENDOLEN.<br>
Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you. Much depends
on your reply.<br>

CECILY.<br>
Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff, kindly
answer me the following question. Why did you pretend to be my
guardian’s brother?<br>

ALGERNON.<br>
In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.<br>

CECILY.<br>
[To Gwendolen.] That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does
it not?<br>

GWENDOLEN.<br>
Yes, dear, if you can believe him.<br>

CECILY.<br>
I don’t. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.<br>

GWENDOLEN.<br>
True. In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital
thing. Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for
pretending to have a brother? Was it in order that you might have an
opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?<br>

JACK.<br>
Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?<br>

GWENDOLEN.<br>
I have the gravest doubts upon the subject. But I intend to crush them.
This is not the moment for German scepticism. [Moving to Cecily.] Their
explanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially Mr.
Worthing’s. That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.<br>

CECILY.<br>
I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said. His voice alone
inspires one with absolute credulity.<br>

GWENDOLEN.<br>
Then you think we should forgive them?<br>

CECILY.<br>
Yes. I mean no.<br>

GWENDOLEN.<br>
True! I had forgotten. There are principles at stake that one cannot
surrender. Which of us should tell them? The task is not a pleasant
one.<br>

CECILY.<br>
Could we not both speak at the same time?<br>

GWENDOLEN.<br>
An excellent idea! I nearly always speak at the same time as other
people. Will you take the time from me?<br>

CECILY.<br>
Certainly. [Gwendolen beats time with uplifted finger.]<br>

GWENDOLEN and CECILY [Speaking together.] Your Christian names are
still an insuperable barrier. That is all!<br>

JACK and ALGERNON [Speaking together.] Our Christian names! Is that
all? But we are going to be christened this afternoon.<br>

Certainly not.

Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff, kindly

 Our Christian names! Is that
