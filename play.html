<h4> THIRD ACT<br>

<h5>CECILY.</h5>
<p>A most distasteful one.</p>

<h5>GWENDOLEN.</h5>
<p>But we will not be the first to speak.</p>

<h5>CECILY.</h5>
<p>Certainly not.</p>

<h5>GWENDOLEN.</h5>
<p>Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you. Much depends
on your reply.</p>

<h5>CECILY.</h5>
<p>Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff, kindly
answer me the following question. Why did you pretend to be my
guardian’s brother?</p>

<h5>ALGERNON.</h5>
<p>In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.</p>

<h5>CECILY.</h5>
<p>[To Gwendolen.]</p><p>That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does
it not?</p>

<h5>GWENDOLEN.</h5>
<p>Yes, dear, if you can believe him.</p>

<h5>CECILY.</h5>
<p>I don’t. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.</p>
