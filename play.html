<h5 class="cecily"> CECILY.</h5>
<p id="K">A most distasteful one.</p>

<h5 class = gwendolen>GWENDOLEN.</h5>
<p id="K">But we will not be the first to speak.</p>

<h5 class="cecily"> CECILY.</h5>
<p id="K">Certainly not.</p>

<h5 class = "gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h5>
<p id="K">Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you. Much depends
on your reply.</p>

<h5 class="cecily">CECILY.</h5>
<p id="K">Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff, kindly
answer me the following question. Why did you pretend to be my
guardian’s brother?</p>

<h5 class = "algernon">ALGERNON.</h5>
<p id="K">In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.</p>

<h5 class="cecily">CECILY.</h5>
<p id ="K"><spam id="M" >[To Gwendolen.]</spam>
<p>That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?</p>
</p>
<h5 class ="gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h5>
<p id="K">Yes, dear, if you can believe him.</p>

<h5 class="cecily">CECILY.</h5>
<p id="K">I don’t. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.</p>
